You need to create a main screen with a view model. On the screen, we display the left part of the picture. Image width is 150, height is 0.3 the height of the screen (with the possibility of rotating the screen).
There are three buttons with a stroke of 3, height of 56, corner radius 18. The main color is blue, the stroke is indigo, text is white.
